meta_analysis
=============

Python package containing some useful functions when running a meta-analysis.


I wrapped some functions that were useful when publishing a meta-analysis in neuroscience, during my time in Amsterdam as a researcher.
I though it could be useful for other folks.

Check out thist post for a walk through.

Note that I am not a specialist, and these implementations come from research papers. Be critical and double check my work :)
